Difference between Maximum likelihood, maximum aposteriori, Bayesian estimation.
In ML and MAP we get a single estimation of the parameter. Though in MAP method we use prior information of the parameter, we still get a single estimate. We do not worry about the posterior distribution. Where as in the Bayesian estimation, we consider the posterior distribution which uses the idea called conjugate priors - the prior and the posterior distibutions will be same. The prior distribution parameters will be updated in the posterior distribution.
